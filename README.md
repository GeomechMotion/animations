# GeomechMotion - animations skeleton

This is a minimal skeleton for your `GeomechMotion/animations` repository,
including a simple static gallery built with HTML + CSS and generated by
a small Python script.

## Structure

```text
animations/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css
│   └── videos/          <- put all your .mp4/.webm/.mov/.gif here
├── docs/                <- GitHub Pages will serve this folder
│   └── index.html       <- generated automatically
└── build_site.py        <- generator script
```

## Usage

1. Copy this structure into your existing `GeomechMotion/animations` repo.
2. Move all your videos from `Ready/` (and subfolders) into `assets/videos/`.
3. From the root of the repo, run:

   ```bash
   python build_site.py
   ```

   This will scan `assets/videos/`, create one HTML page per video in `docs/`,
   and generate a main `docs/index.html` gallery.

4. Commit and push to GitHub.
5. In your repository settings on GitHub, enable GitHub Pages and set:

   - Source: `main` branch
   - Folder: `/docs`

6. Your site will be available at something like:

   `https://geomechmotion.github.io/animations/`
